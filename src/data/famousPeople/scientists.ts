    simulation: "amy-amd-rp",
    description: "Dr. Amy Bower was diagnosed at 24 with juvenile macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa. She retains a 'small crescent-shaped sliver' of vision and light perception, watching her sight slowly slip away over decades.\n\nShe uses screen magnifiers, screen readers, and a service dog.\n\n• Senior Scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\n\n• Groundbreaking research on ocean currents using sound and non-visual methods\n\n• Pioneer in making oceanographic research accessible"

    description: "Gustaf Dalén became completely blind in 1912 when an acetylene experiment exploded during testing. The accident destroyed both eyes, leaving him with no light perception.\n\n• Nobel Prize in Physics (1912) for automatic regulators for lighthouse illumination - awarded while recovering from the accident\n\n• Continued as managing director of AGA despite blindness\n\n• Invented the AGA cooker (still sold today as Aga range cookers)\n\n• Held over 100 patents"

    simulation: "complete-blindness",
    description: "Jacob Bolotin was born completely blind, with no light perception from birth. He overcame immense barriers in medical education at a time when blind people were expected to live in institutions.\n\n• World's first totally blind licensed physician\n\n• Specialized in diseases of the heart and lungs\n\n• Strong advocate for employment and integration of blind individuals\n\n• Proved that blindness need not be a barrier to professional achievement"
