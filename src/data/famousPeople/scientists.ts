    description: "Joseph Plateau damaged his retinas through prolonged direct solar observation around 1829, leading to progressive deterioration and total blindness by 1843.\n\nHe experienced a dark central scotoma (blind spot at fixation point), preserved peripheral vision initially, severe acuity loss, and persistent afterimages from the solar damage. Over ~14 years, his remaining vision gradually dimmed until complete blindness.\n\n• Invented the phenakistoscope - precursor to modern cinema and animation\n\n• Made fundamental contributions to understanding visual perception and persistence of vision\n\n• Continued scientific work after blindness with help from family and colleagues\n\n• Plateau's laws of soap films still used in mathematics and physics",

    description: "Leonhard Euler lost his right eye completely around 1738 from a severe fever/infection, leaving that side in total darkness. His left eye developed a progressive cataract, creating milky fog, glare sensitivity, and washed-out colors that worsened until total blindness by 1771.\n\nFor ~33 years he worked with only his left eye, then ~12 years in complete darkness.\n\n• One of the greatest mathematicians in history\n\n• Produced roughly half of his life's work after becoming totally blind\n\n• Made fundamental contributions to calculus, graph theory, mechanics, and optics\n\n• Dictated research to assistants, including his children",
