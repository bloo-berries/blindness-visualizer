  gustafDalen: {
    name: "Gustaf Dalén",
    condition: "Blindness from Explosion Accident",
    years: "1869-1937",
    onset: "Age 43, from explosion in 1912",
    simulation: "complete-blindness",
    description: "Gustaf Dalén was a Swedish engineer and inventor who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1912 for his invention of automatic regulators for use in conjunction with gas accumulators for illuminating lighthouses and buoys. He became completely blind later that same year due to an explosion accident during an acetylene experiment. Despite his blindness, he continued to work as the managing director of AGA and made further significant contributions to technology, including the development of the AGA cooker.

  jacobBolotin: {
    name: "Jacob Bolotin",
    condition: "Congenital Blindness",
    years: "1888-1924",
    onset: "From birth",
    simulation: "complete-blindness",
    description: "Jacob Bolotin was the world's first totally blind person to become a licensed physician. Despite being blind from birth, he overcame significant barriers to medical education and became a successful doctor specializing in diseases of the heart and lungs. He was a strong advocate for the employment and integration of blind individuals into society, demonstrating that blindness need not be a barrier to professional achievement.

  josephPlateau: {
    name: "Joseph Plateau",
    condition: "Blindness from Experimental Exposure",
    years: "1801-1883",
    onset: "Age 42, in 1843",
    simulation: "complete-blindness",
    description: "Joseph Plateau was a Belgian physicist and mathematician who made significant contributions to the study of visual perception. He invented the phenakistoscope, an early animation device that demonstrated the illusion of motion and is considered a precursor to modern cinema. He became blind in 1843, likely due to his experiments involving prolonged exposure to bright light, particularly staring at the sun. Despite his blindness, he continued his scientific work with the help of his family and colleagues. Learn more at en.wikipedia.org."

    onset: "Progressive, complete blindness in later years",
    simulation: "euler-progressive-blindness",
    description: "Leonhard Euler was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, and astronomer who made fundamental contributions to mathematics, physics, and engineering. He experienced progressive eyesight deterioration and became completely blind in his later years. Despite his blindness, he continued his prolific mathematical work with remarkable productivity, dictating his research to assistants and relying on his exceptional memory and mental calculation abilities. Euler is considered one of the greatest mathematicians in history, with his work influencing countless areas of mathematics and science. Learn more at en.wikipedia.org."

    name: "Wanda Díaz-Merced",
    condition: "Degenerative Diabetic Retinopathy",
    years: "Born (Contemporary)",
    onset: "Early twenties",
    simulation: "wanda-diabetic-retinopathy",
    description: "Wanda Díaz-Merced is a Puerto Rican astronomer and astrophysicist known for pioneering the use of sonification to turn large astronomical data sets into audible sound. She lost her sight in her early twenties due to complications with degenerative diabetic retinopathy. Rather than abandon her career, she developed innovative techniques to study stellar radiation and astrophysical data using sound, discovering that she could detect patterns in stellar radio data through audio that might be obscured in visual representations. Currently the Director of the Arecibo Observatory and working at the European Gravitational Observatory, Díaz-Merced has been recognized as one of the 7 most trailblazing women in science by the BBC.
