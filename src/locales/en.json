      "darkness": {
        "question": "Do blind people see complete darkness/blackness?",
        "answer": "Not necessarily. About 85% of legally blind people have some remaining vision. Only 10-15% experience total darkness. Many see light/shadow, colors, or blurry shapes. Some who've never had sight don't experience \"blackness\" as a concept - similar to how you don't \"see\" blackness behind your head."
      },
      "technology": {
        "question": "How do blind people use smartphones and computers?",
        "answer": "Screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver) convert text to speech or braille. Gestures and keyboard shortcuts replace mouse use. Many use normal smartphones with built-in accessibility features. Voice assistants like Siri are heavily utilized."
      },
      "independence": {
        "question": "Can blind people live independently?",
        "answer": "Yes. With proper training and adaptive techniques, blind people cook, clean, work, raise families, and live fully independent lives. They use systematic organization, tactile markers, assistive technology, and mobility tools."

      "senses": {
        "question": "Do blind people have heightened other senses?",
        "answer": "No, their other senses aren't biologically superior. They develop better attention to and processing of audio/tactile information through practice and necessity. It's enhanced perception, not enhanced sensation."
      },
      "interaction": {
        "question": "How should I interact with a blind person?",

Looking online, I found next to nothing regarding stroke-related vision loss at the scale I experienced it. Accurately describing how I \"see\" the world was painfully difficult, and only added to the isolation.",
